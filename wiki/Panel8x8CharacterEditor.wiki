#Panel8x8CharacterEditor - Character editor for the Panel8x8 Library

= Introduction =

Character editor for the Panel8x8 Library

*Example 6 - Serial Update must be loaded to the panels for any of the Panel8x8Support to work.  This is because the DotNet code communicates with the array using the serial interface.  This is the same interface you use to program the array, so note the channel you are using in the Arduino studio.  The Serial debugging window cannot be active while using the Panel8x8Support (that's a port sharing violation in Windows!)  Also, please be sure to set the port to 9600 baud, that's the current setting per the Panel8x8Serial object code.*

This is the program I used to work on the Rom Fonts included in the library. 

Allows cutting and pasting of data in a source code compatible format. 

This applicaton does not directly interact with the library.
